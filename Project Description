  This project is a mobile app developed with Android Studio and Kotlin. The objective of this project
is to build an application that will simplify the process of cities/towns communicating with their
citizens. It will allow city admins to create and verify a city page, which citizens can then
subscribe to and receive notifications when alerts are pushed to said page. 
  The intent of this project is to provide a free and easy way for citizens to be able to receive
alerts from their city/town.
